# not only password analyzer
This small tool is capable of suggesting passwords and analyzing what your password... 

You can not only just get a suggestion but it also gives you a nice results about that if your password is breached or it is not comprmised

it also tell you about the entropy of your password...and its strength


# FEATURES
1-Check password strength (length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)

2-Calculate password entropy

3-Classify password as Very Weak / Weak / Medium / Strong

4-Check if the password has been breached (using SHA-1 hashing)

# REQUIRMENTS
you must have python3

also "pip install requests"

# working 
entropy calculation = L*log2(T)

L is the lenght of password 

T is the number of possible charecters used

Breach---A data breach happens when hackers steal or leak sensitive information (like usernames, emails, and passwords) from a company’s database

In Short 

A breach = leaked/stolen password database.

Breach check = making sure the password hasn’t been exposed before.
